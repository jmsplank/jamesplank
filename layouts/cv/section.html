                        Involved in a variety of engineering projects in the lead up to
                        the launch of the FARADAY-1 satellite. Worked on pojects such
                        as: 1) Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT), particularly RF
                        interference testing under different flight configurations.
                        Involved SDR scripting and FPGA programming. 2) Design of a
                        "flatsat" replica of spacecraft hardware, used for development
                        and debugging. Led the entire design life-cycle (under light
                        sanity-check supervision), inc. initial CAD drawings, production
                        of BoM, procurement, assembly and testing. 3) Physics problems,
                        e.g. Doppler-shift predictions for S-Band broadcast freqs
                        across groundstation flyby. I really enjoyed the opportunity to
                        work with and learn from people, all with a great passion and
                        decades of experience.
